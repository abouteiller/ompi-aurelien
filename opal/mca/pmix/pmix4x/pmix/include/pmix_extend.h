 *
 * PMIx provides a "function-shipping" approach to support for
 * implementing the server-side of the protocol. This method allows
 * resource managers to implement the server without being burdened
 * with PMIx internal details. Accordingly, each PMIx API is mirrored
 * here in a function call to be provided by the server. When a
 * request is received from the client, the corresponding server function
 * will be called with the information.
 *
 * Any functions not supported by the RM can be indicated by a NULL for
 * the function pointer. Client calls to such functions will have a
 * "not supported" error returned.
