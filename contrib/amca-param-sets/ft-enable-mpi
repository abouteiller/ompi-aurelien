# An Aggregate MCA Parameter Set to enable MPI Layer fault tolerance
# capabilities.
#
# Usage:
#   shell$ mpirun -am ft-enable-mpi ./app
#

#
# OPAL Parameters
#

# ORTE Parameters
# - Use the modified 'cm' routed component - 'rts'. It is the only one that is currently able to
#   handle process and daemon loss.
#
# JJH: routed=binomial
routed=rts
#plm=rsh
#rmaps=resilient

# Disable tree spawn for now
plm_rsh_no_tree_spawn = 1

# Stablization at the runtime layer
errmgr_rts_hnp_priority=5000
errmgr_rts_orted_priority=5000

#
# OMPI Parameters
# - Only fully tested with the listed btls
# - ftbasic provides agreement.
#
ompi_ftmpi_enable=1
# UGNI, OpenIB, TCP, SM have been tested to work well and support most failures gracefully.
#   if you want perfectly safe, the following restriction can be set, but we believe its' unecessary.
#   XPMEM is broken and it's build is disabled in this fork.
#btl=tcp,sm,self
# Tuned has been tested and works well in many cases; however, it does have some
#   corner cases. The safer setup "basic,ftbasic" imparts a huge performance 
#   penalty, we encourage you to try "tuned,basic,ftbasic" and see if it works for you, in most cases, it will.
